Cosmetic Suggestion Based on Skin Condition Using AI

An AI-powered web application that analyzes user skin conditions using deep learning and provides personalized cosmetic and skincare recommendations.

⸻

📌 Project Overview

Choosing the right cosmetic products is challenging due to different skin types and conditions. This project uses Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning to analyze facial images and recommend suitable skincare and cosmetic products tailored to the user’s skin condition.

The system leverages image processing and CNN-based deep learning models to identify skin conditions such as:
	•	Dry Skin
	•	Oily Skin
	•	Normal Skin
	•	Sensitive Skin
	•	Scaly Skin
	•	Red Spot Skin
	•	Skin Moles

Based on the detected condition, the application provides personalized skincare routines and product recommendations.
